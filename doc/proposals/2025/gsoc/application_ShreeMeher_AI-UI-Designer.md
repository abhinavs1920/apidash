## Project Title
AI UI Designer for APIs

## Synopsis
This project will develop an AI-based agent that transforms API responses (like JSON and XML) into usable UI components (forms, tables, charts, etc.) with built-in customization and export options.

## Benefits to the Community
This will streamline API testing, visualization, and UI generation — saving developers time and effort.

## Deliverables
- JSON/XML parser
- Component generator (table, card, form, chart)
- Customization controls (filters, pagination)
- UI export options (Flutter/Web)
- Documentation + tests

## Timeline
Will be finalized after initial feedback.

## About Me
I’m a CS student skilled in Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and working with APIs. I'm excited to contribute to API Dash and help make dev tools smarter and more intuitive.
