## Motivation & Past Experience  

### Open Source Contributions  
- My open source journey started from APIDash itself. I discovered it ast year and became a regular user of it.
  - **Repo Links/PRs:**
      - Adding codegen for hyper-rust (https://github.com/foss42/apidash/pull/468) :- I thought this to be a comparitively easy contribution when i started but became challenging when i encountered with lack of multipart functionaility in the package. I made some mistakable commits since it was first PR but with all that happened was still able to make a quality PR
      - SSL Feature (https://github.com/foss42/apidash/pull/512) :- I came across this issue first while testing the hyper codegen i made. I took notice of the issue and when came to learn that the feauture was not in apidash took initiative to make it happen.
      - Client running in background problem even after removal (https://github.com/foss42/apidash/pull/560) ;- A small bug that came across me while using the app.
      - Multipart cancellation error and Request cancellation flow Error :- Both of these errors came acorss me while trying to implement the web socket protocol in the app.

### Proud Project/Achievement  
- **Project Name:** [Project Title]  
- **Why it matters:** [Brief Explanation]  
- **Repo/Link:** [Link to Project]  

### Motivating Challenges  
- I like challenges of two kind, one which demands me to think and implement what i learned. And the other  one is which makes me learn new things.

### Availability for GSoC  
- **Will you work full-time on GSoC?** No  
- **If not, what else will you be working on?** I currently have to meet with my study requirements and have to continue my Btech course. My initial plan is to contribute 2 hours per week days and 5 hours in weekend days which i beleive is enough for achieving the proposals goal.
   

### Communication & Sync-ups  
- **Do you mind regularly syncing up with mentors?** I am totally fine with syncing up with mentors for being uptodated on my work and for feedbacks. If its a virtual meet it would be great to have a heads up about the time.  

### Interest in API Dash  
- **What interests you about API Dash?** 
- **Areas for improvement:** I feel like the application would fullfill its goal as it reaches into wider audience of api testers . And for that the application has to tend to broader needs of api testers.Currently APIDash supports on REST APIs and GRAPHQL in its work flow. It would be great to add in other protocols into the app.
